## Installation

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

- Git Clone the Repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:carlincb/Social-Network-API.git
```

- Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store`, so that these directories are not tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

- Your application should use [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database, and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages. You should have MongoDB installed on your computer. Please follow the [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally. Express and Mongoose are included as dependencies and should be installed by running the following command in the current working directory for this application:

```
npm install
```

- Open your terminal from the root of the file and enter:

```
npm run start
```

- or:

```
npm run dev
```

- The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

- Finally, the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes can all be tested in [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) or similar program.
